# fileRotateAutomation

In my internship within Infrastructure Automation in Ameren in summer 2021, I delivered a SharePoint File Rotate automation script to production so a SharePoint user does not overwrite the same file within a given SharePoint directory. Script was configurable by taking in a cutoff year to rotate files at and the respective SharePoint location and creates archive folders based on year. Built and drove the development of Pester unit tests within Powershell to simulate file rotation locally.
